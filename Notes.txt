1. - I went over the allowed time. By the time it was 90 minutes, I had very little to show. Sorry

2. - In hindsight, I would have liked to put a placeholder text on the reviews page when there are no reviews posted.
   - I would have added effects when posting a new review or switching between products.
   - Maybe used react hooks for the home page.
